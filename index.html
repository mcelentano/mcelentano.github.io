<td align="left"><p>I am a Miller Fellow at UC Berkeley working in the <a href="https://statistics.berkeley.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Statistics Department</a> and hosted by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Martin Wainwright</a> and <a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/index.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Ryan Tibshirani</a>. I am broadly interested in problems in high-dimensional statistics. In particular, I have spent of a lot of time working on exact asymptotics, debiasing, and inference in high-dimensional models. I am also interested in the interplay between statistical estimation and computational constraints. In the past, I participating as a visiting postdoc in the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/si2021" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Computational Complexity of Statistical Inference</a> program at the Simons Institute, and I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://fodsi.us/index.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Foundations of Data Science Institute (FODSI)</a>. From April 2020 to September 2021, I helped organize the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ocis/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Online Causal Inference Seminar</a>. </p>
<p>Prior to the Miller Fellowship, I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Stanford Statistics Department</a>, advised by Professor <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Andrea Montanari</a> and supported in part by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>. My thesis developed new results and methods in high-dimensional linear regression using exact asymtotics and received the Theodore W. Anderson Theory of Statistics Award. In the summer of 2019, I held an internship at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Microsoft Research New England</a>, and was fortunate to be hosted by <a href="http://vsyrgkanis.com/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Vasilis Syrgkanis</a> and <a href="https://gregmlewis.com/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Greg Lewis</a>. I received a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics in 2014 and a master's degree in electrical engineering in 2016, both from Stanford University. </p>
<p>Outside of statistics, I enjoy biking, hiking, and reading, and particularly enjoy political memoirs. </p>
