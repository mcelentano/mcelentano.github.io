I am a Miller Fellow at UC Berkeley working in the [https://statistics.berkeley.edu/ Statistics Department] and hosted by [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/ Martin Wainwright]. I am broadly interested in problems in high-dimensional statistics. In particular, I have spent of a lot of time working on exact asymptotics, debiasing, and inference in high-dimensional models. I am also interested in the interplay between statistical estimation and computational constraints. I am currently participating as a visiting postdoc in the [https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/si2021 Computational Complexity of Statistical Inference] program at the Simons Institute. I also help organize the [https://sites.google.com/view/ocis/ Online Causal Inference Seminar]. 

Prior to the Miller Fellowship, I completed my PhD at the [https://statistics.stanford.edu/ Stanford Statistics Department], advised by Professor [https://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/ Andrea Montanari] and supported in part by the [https://www.nsfgrfp.org/ NSF Graduate Research Fellowship]. My thesis developed new results and methods in high-dimensional linear regression using exact asymtotics and received the Theodore W. Anderson Theory of Statistics Award. In the summer of 2019, I held an internship at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/ Microsoft Research New England], and was fortunate to be hosted by [http://vsyrgkanis.com/ Vasilis Syrgkanis] and [https://gregmlewis.com/ Greg Lewis]. Before my PhD, I received a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics in 2014 and a master's degree in electrical engineering in 2016, both from Stanford University. 

Outside of statistics, I enjoy biking, hiking, and reading, and particularly enjoy political memoirs. 

I am in the process of moving, and do not yet have a UC Berkeley email address. In the meantime, feel free to reach me at my previous email address mcelen (at) stanford (dot) edu.
