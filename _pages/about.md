I am a Miller Fellow at UC Berkeley working in the Department of Statistics. I am hosted by [Martin Wainwright](https://computing.mit.edu/martin-wainwright/) and [Ryan Tibshirani](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ryantibs/) and am grateful to be mentored by [Yun Song](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/). I develop algorithms for analyzing high-dimensional data. I am particularly interested in how errors from complex prediction models lead to bias and overconfidence in downstream analyses. I develop methods to correct this bias and correctly calibrate inferences. My work intersects with causal inference, exact asymptotics, debiased machine learning, and Gaussian processes. I also work on applications in biology. **I am on the 2023-24 job market.**

In 2021, I obtained my PhD in Statistics from Stanford University, advised by [Andrea Montanari](http://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/) and supported in part by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). My dissertation won the Theodore W. Anderson Theory of Statistics Award. I received a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics in 2014 and a master's degree in electrical engineering in 2016, both from Stanford University.

In the summer of 2019, I held an internship at [Microsoft Research New England](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/), and was fortunate to be hosted by [Vasilis Syrgkanis](https://vsyrgkanis.com/) and [Greg Lewis](https://www.gregmlewis.com/). In Fall 2021, I participated as a visiting postdoc in the [Computational Complexity of Statistical Inference](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/computational-complexity-statistical-inference) program at the [Simons Insitute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage). From April 2020 to September 2021, I helped organize the [Online Causal Inference Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/ocis/). Outside of statistics, I enjoy biking, cooking, and reading.
