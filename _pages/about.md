I am a [Miller Fellow](https://miller.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley working in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/). I am hosted by [Martin Wainwright](https://computing.mit.edu/martin-wainwright/) and [Ryan Tibshirani](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ryantibs/), and I am grateful to be mentored by [Yun Song](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/). In 2021, I obtained my PhD in Statistics from Stanford University, advised by [Andrea Montanari](http://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/) and supported in part by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). My dissertation won the Theodore W. Anderson Theory of Statistics Award. I received a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics in 2014 and a master's degree in electrical engineering in 2016, both from Stanford University.

In the summer of 2019, I held an internship at [Microsoft Research New England](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/), and was fortunate to be hosted by [Vasilis Syrgkanis](https://vsyrgkanis.com/) and [Greg Lewis](https://www.gregmlewis.com/). In Fall 2021, I participated as a visiting postdoc in the [Computational Complexity of Statistical Inference](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/computational-complexity-statistical-inference) program at the [Simons Insitute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/homepage). From April 2020 to September 2021, I helped organize the [Online Causal Inference Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/ocis/). Outside of statistics, I enjoy biking, cooking, and reading.

**I am on the 2023-24 job market.** Here is [my CV]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /files/CV.pdf %}).

# Research interests

I develop algorithms for analyzing high-dimensional data. I am particularly interested in how errors from complex and high-dimensional prediction models lead to bias and overconfidence in downstream analyses. I develop methods to correct this bias and correctly calibrate inferences. I also work on average-case analysis of first-order methods on non-convex objectives ([here](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v125/celentano20a), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07572)) and variational Bayesian inference ([here](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-51/issue-2/Local-convexity-of-the-TAP-free-energy-and-AMP-convergence/10.1214/23-AOS2257.short), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09550), [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ceYx2EqRLh4fFzqZQew7lSN8U0BoTo7c/view?usp=drive_link)). My work intersects with semiparametrics, high-dimensional causal inference, exact asymptotics, debiased machine learning, and Gaussian processes. 

In the short term, my primary research objective is to flesh out a rich theory and methodological toolbox for semi-parametric estimation and inference in ''inconsistency regimes.'' These are regimes in which nuisance parameter are high-dimensional and unstructured, so cannot be estimated well: see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01362), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14172), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13716).

Since Spring 2022, I have worked with Yun Song on tree-based methods to estimate fitness in evolving populations, and am broadly interested in high-dimensional statistical problems in biology.
